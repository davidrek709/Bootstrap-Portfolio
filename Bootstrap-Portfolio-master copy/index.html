        <p>
                Programming has been an interest of mine since around middle school when I played my first game, I took a
                programming class in High School
            
                which allowed me to create simple calculators and games based on buttons. Programming took a backseat when I started
                playing soccer and just
                recently I decided that this is what I want to make a career from. Traveling is a big factor in my life, whenever I
                have free time I love to
                travel with family or friends
        </p>
        <p>
                I've started to fill up my portfolio with interesting projects to showcase the skills I've learned with html, css,
                and java. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Javascript is a large language that takes several months, I'm dedicated to learning as much as I can
